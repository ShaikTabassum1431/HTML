<h2>Mountains</h2>
<h4>Why Mountains</h4>
<p>Mountains collect, channel and store freshwater and are essential to the Earth's water cycle. They are also key to regulating the global climate and vital to other ecological cycles of the planet.</p>
<h5>The main reason</h5>
<p>Mountains form where two continental plates collide. Since both plates have a similar thickness and weight, neither one will sink under the other. Instead, they crumple and fold until the rocks are forced up to form a mountain range. As the plates continue to collide, mountains will get taller and taller.</p>
